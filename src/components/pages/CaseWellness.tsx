      overview="Wellness Personas of SNU is an interactive web application that identifies a user's lifestyle persona based on their daily habits. It combines a trained KMeans clustering model with a human-centred Streamlit interface to help Sister Nivedita University students understand and reflect on their wellness patterns in an engaging, personalised way."
      problem="Students often lack awareness about how their daily habits — food choices, social activity, exercise, hobbies — connect to their overall wellness. There was no engaging, low-friction way for students to reflect on these patterns and get actionable, personalised insights without filling out long surveys or visiting a counsellor."
      solution="Built an interactive system that collects 8 lifestyle inputs through simple sliders, runs them through a pre-trained KMeans clustering model, and instantly assigns the user to one of 10 meaningful personas. Each persona comes with a radar chart visualisation, a descriptive profile, and a motivational quote — making the experience feel personal, not clinical."

Features were standardised using StandardScaler before clustering. The trained model and scaler were serialised with Joblib for production use in the Streamlit app. Each cluster was manually labelled and described based on its centroid values."

          body: "The app was deployed on Streamlit Cloud and used by SNU students for lifestyle reflection. The interactive format drove significantly higher engagement than traditional survey formats. Users reported that seeing their persona radar chart was a 'mirror moment' — it matched how they actually felt about their lifestyle."
