      overview="ZeroShield AI is a full-stack cybersecurity platform that simulates a real-world Security Operations Centre (SOC). It provides a unified dashboard for real-time threat monitoring, AI-based anomaly detection, attack simulation, and automated incident response — making complex security operations understandable and actionable."
      problem="Traditional cybersecurity systems are fragmented, complex to interpret, and require deep expertise to operate. Security analysts juggle multiple tools, dashboards, and alert streams — leading to alert fatigue, slow response times, and missed threats. There's a critical need for a unified platform that simplifies threat visibility and response."
      solution="Designed and built a centralised SOC dashboard that integrates monitoring, detection, simulation, and response into a single interface. The platform uses an AI logic layer for anomaly detection, a simulation engine for attack modelling, and automated response actions — all presented through a clear, hierarchy-driven UI that supports fast decision-making."

          title: "Dashboard Design",
          body: "The interface is designed to resemble a modern enterprise SOC dashboard, with a dark-mode aesthetic that reduces eye strain during long monitoring sessions. Key metrics (risk score, active threats, system activity) are positioned in the primary visual zone. Secondary data (logs, intelligence feed) occupies the lower area. Every element has a clear visual hierarchy — critical information is impossible to miss."

It can generate realistic attack patterns for DDoS (traffic spike simulation), API injection (malformed request sequences), and lateral movement (abnormal internal connection graphs). Each simulation updates the risk score, populates the threat feed, and triggers appropriate automated responses — giving analysts a safe environment to test their response playbooks."
