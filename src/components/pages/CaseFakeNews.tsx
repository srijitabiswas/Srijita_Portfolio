      overview="A supervised machine learning system that automatically classifies news articles as Fake or Real using natural language processing techniques. With misinformation spreading rapidly across digital platforms, this project explores how ML can provide a scalable first-line defence against fake news."
      problem="Fake news spreads faster than fact-checks. Manual verification is slow, doesn't scale, and is impossible to apply to the volume of content published daily. There was a need for an automated system that could analyse news text and classify it reliably — helping platforms, journalists, and readers make faster decisions about content credibility."
      solution="Built a supervised ML classification pipeline that preprocesses raw news text, extracts TF-IDF features, and classifies articles using Logistic Regression and Passive-Aggressive Classifier. The system achieves 93.58% accuracy on the test set, with balanced precision and recall across both classes."

          title: "Why TF-IDF Works Here",
          body: "Fake news articles often overuse sensational terms, emotional language, and specific trigger words that rarely appear in credible journalism. TF-IDF downweights common words (like 'the', 'said') and upweights words that are distinctive to each class — making it highly effective for separating factual from sensational writing styles."
