      overview="Savor is a food ordering experience built around one idea: less is more. Instead of showing every restaurant in the city, Savor guides users to the right meal through budget-first filtering, curated recommendations, and Crave Assistant — a conversational AI that understands natural-language cravings like 'something spicy but light' and returns the top 3 matches with clear reasoning, backed by a real MongoDB database of 1,100+ dishes."
      problem="Most food delivery apps prioritize endless scrolling and promotion-heavy feeds over decision-making. Users open the app hungry but spend more time browsing than ordering — overwhelmed by choice, weak personalization, and cluttered layouts."
      solution="Savor flips the model by leading with budget and craving instead of menus. A custom intent-detection layer parses budget, spice level, diet, allergens, and lifestyle context directly from natural language, then scores and ranks dishes via MongoDB aggregation — zero external AI API cost. The result: a curated shortlist instead of an endless feed, and a 'why you'll like this' reason behind every recommendation."

Low-fidelity wireframes focused on information hierarchy — what does the user absolutely need to see at each step? The final design uses a warm orange accent palette while staying minimal, then I built the intent-detection NLP layer and MongoDB scoring engine that powers Crave Assistant end-to-end."

Moving from a static frontend mock to a full MERN stack with a real recommendation engine validated that the decision-first model holds up under real data at scale — 1,100+ dishes, real auth, and a live database."
